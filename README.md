# Pressure Hub
## Description
This is a lightweight script for Roblox Pressure! I only made this since I couldn't find one which wasn't hidden behind some scammy website. This script has features such as fullbright, anti entities, godmode, walkspeed buffs, FOV changes, and much, much more! There is no strict update schedule; I just add features when I have time :)
## Installation (Only 3 steps)
1. Open your script executor
2. Copy and paste this: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xBackpack/PressureHub/main/main.lua"))()
3. Execute

Done!
